# =============================================================================
# NOTES ON REGIONAL TRANSITIONS AND ODD MAPPINGS
# =============================================================================
#
# TRANSITION TIMING:
# - The major regional reorganization occurred between Jan 1, 2024 and Feb 1, 2024
# - Bantry General Hospital: Moved from "HSE Dublin and South East" to "HSE South West" on Feb 1, 2024
#   (Confirmed via website: operates under Cork University Hospital in HSE South region)
#
# GEOGRAPHICALLY ODD MAPPINGS THAT STILL NEED VERIFICATION:
# These mappings are based on actual position in the scraped data, but seem geographically wrong:
#
# - Ennis Hospital → "HSE South West"
#   (Ennis is in Clare, seems like it should be Mid West with Limerick)
#
# - Galway University Hospital → "HSE Mid West"
#   (Galway seems like it should be West & North West with Mayo/Sligo/Letterkenny)
