Goal:
collect colors for each hospital at each date

Green, orange and red The report uses a colour code to show if hospitals are operating within their threshold. Green means the number of people on trolleys is within the hospital's threshold. Orange means that the number of people on trolleys is just below the hospital's threshold. Red means that the number of people on trolleys is over the hospital's threshold.
