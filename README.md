# Modeling HSE daily trolly data 
Project exploring the HSE Emergency Care Report Trolley data. Current aim is to fit autoregressive models for exploration. Long term goals involve applying a bayesian ranking model such as in [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14723). Note: Currently the organization of the repo is a bit of a mess.
## Exploratory analysis
* Using bayes/rJAGS: AR(1) model of weekly rate (per 10,000 people) with an annual cycle component
